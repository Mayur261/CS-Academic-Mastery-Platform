        <h2>History of C</h2>
        <p>Martin Richards developed BCPL, which stands for Basic Combined Programming Language, in 1966.</p>
        <p>Ken Thompson, who worked at Bell Labs, developed the B language in 1969. He was also the developer of the UNIX Operating System and created the first master-level chess program called Belle in 1980.</p>
        <p>Dennis Ritchie is the developer of the C language. He did this work in 1972 at AT&T's LABs in the USA. He was also a co-developer of the UNIX Operating System.</p>

        <h2>Introduction to C Programming Language</h2>
        <p>C programming is a popular computer programming language used for system and application software. It was originally developed by Dennis M. Ritchie to create the UNIX operating system at Bell Labs.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Easy to learn</li>
            <li>Structured language</li>
            <li>Produces efficient programs</li>
            <li>Can handle low-level activities</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Why C Language is Important?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Oracle is Written in C</li>
            <li>Core libraries of Android are written in C</li>
            <li>MySQL is Written in C</li>
            <li>Almost every Device Driver is written in C</li>
            <li>Major part of Web Browser is written in C</li>
            <li>Unix operating System is Written in C</li>
            <li>C language is the worldâ€™s most popular programming language</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>For Students</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>C is important to build programming skills.</li>
            <li>Language is a medium to express our thoughts and thinking.</li>
            <li>C Covers basic features of all programming languages.</li>
            <li>C is the most popular language for hardware-dependent programming.</li>

            <li>Documentation Section: In this section, we comment or note down information that is used in the future. Comments do not show in the output.</li>
            <li>Link Section: In this section, we include header files which contain pre-defined functions.</li>
            <li>Definition Section: In this section, we use symbolic Constants which are used in the program.</li>
            <li>Global Declaration Section: In this section, we declare global variables which are used anywhere in the program.</li>
            <li>Main Section: This Section is essential and is divided into two parts: (i) Declaration Part (ii) Executable Part</li>
            <li>Subprogram Section: In this section, we use different functions that are used throughout the program.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Variables</h2>
        <p>Variables are memory locations in a computer's memory used to store data. Each variable should be given a unique name called an identifier. Variable names are the symbolic representation of a memory location.</p>
        <p>Example: <code>int num;</code> where <code>int</code> is the data type, and <code>num</code> is the variable name.</p>
        <p>Rules for writing variable names in C:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Variable names can be composed of letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, and underscores '_' only.</li>
            <li>The first letter of a variable should be either a letter or an underscore. Starting variable names with an underscore is discouraged.</li>
            <li>There is no rule for the length of a variable, but the first 31 characters of a variable are discriminated by the compiler.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Data Types</h2>
        <p>Data types are predefined words used to define how much space should be allocated and what data can be stored in a variable.</p>
        <p>Types of Data Types:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Primary/Fundamental/Basic</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Integer type</li>
                <li>Character type</li>
                <li>Float type</li>
                <li>Double type</li>
                <li>Void</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Secondary/Derived</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Arrays</li>
                <li>Pointers</li>
                <li>Structures</li>
                <li>Enumeration</li>
